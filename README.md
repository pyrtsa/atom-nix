# Nix Syntax Highlighting

This implements syntax highlighting for [Nix](http://nixos.org).

It implements the full grammar and marks mistakes but due to the highlighter not being a full parser it will allow some mistakes and will mark some legal constructs as invalid (rare).

See [the SublimeText version](https://github.com/wmertens/sublime-nix/blob/master/nix.YAML-tmLanguage) for the YAML definition with comments.
